<div id="textarea">I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</div>

<h4>Day 1</h4>
<p>On our first day, we started by visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre"><em>Montmartre</em></a> right away. Our second stop was the <a id="tower">Eiffel Tower</a> (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

<h4>Day 2</h4>
<p>On our second day, we went shopping on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es"><em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em></a>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br>
<br>
After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <a id="louvre"><em>le Louvre</em></a>.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>
<p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
